Tic Tac Toe Game

It is a personal copy of my group project from my Object-oriented Programming class. 

This game project was built by 3 team members utilizing OOP concepts such as Observer (MVC) and Strategy Design Patterns. It is a 3 x 3 grid Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play at the same time
defined by some game rules.
